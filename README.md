# Offensive Security Research & Tool Analysis

## About This Repository
This repository contains educational security research projects and proof-of-concept tools developed in controlled, isolated lab environments. The purpose is to **understand adversary techniques from a defender's perspective** and improve detection capabilities through hands-on exploration.

⚠️ **Legal & Ethical Notice:**  
All tools and demonstrations are for **educational and research purposes only**. They were developed and tested in authorized, isolated virtual environments. Unauthorized use against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical.

## 📁 Project: Adversarial Tool Research 
**Purpose:** To deconstruct malware techniques by building a controlled proof-of-concept keylogger with basic Command & Control (C2) functionality. This project explores:
- Keystroke capture mechanisms
- Data exfiltration methods
- Basic persistence techniques
- Defensive detection strategies

**Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Understanding how keyloggers operate at a code level
- Analyzing network covert channels
- Developing detection rules and threat-hunting queries
- Applying MITRE ATT&CK techniques (e.g., T1056.001, T1041)

## 🎓 About Me
I'm a cybersecurity professional specializing in offensive security and penetration testing, with a 2:1 BSc (Hons) in Cybersecurity from the University of Kent. My approach combines academic knowledge with hands-on lab research to understand and counter real-world threats.

**Currently:** Advancing practical skills through TCM Security's PNPT certification path, focusing on network penetration testing, privilege escalation, and Active Directory exploitation.

**Professional Experience:** Penetration Testing intern at UltEnterprise, where I contributed to client vulnerability assessments and threat modeling projects.
